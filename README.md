# Natural Language Inference

## Overview
Welcome to the Natural Language Inference Exploration project! This repository chronicles my immersive journey into the dynamic field of natural language processing. The primary focus was to comprehend the intricate relationships between text statements, a vital aspect in the realm of artificial intelligence. The project extensively engages with three distinct datasets: SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference), MultiNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference), and ANLI (Adversarial Natural Language Inference).

## Outcome


## Motivation
The motivation behind this exploration stems from the profound impact a nuanced understanding of language can have on advancing artificial intelligence applications. The project aspires to contribute to the evolution of sentiment analysis, chatbots, and various natural language processing applications.

## Key Features
- **Model Exploration:** Dive into a rich array of models, including MLP, LSTM, BiLSTM, Attention Model, ELMo, and BERT, each meticulously evaluated for performance and suitability.
- **Dataset Navigation:** Successfully processed and navigated three challenging datasets - SNLI, MultiNLI, and ANLI - demonstrating adaptability to diverse data structures.
- **Results and Reports:** The repository includes a detailed report outlining results, observations, and insights from the model evaluations.
